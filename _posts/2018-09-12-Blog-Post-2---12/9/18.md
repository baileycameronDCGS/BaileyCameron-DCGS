    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had written down the alphabet from A to Z and I was working on the code to accompany it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson</td>
    <td>I wanted to finish the code and try out new different codes to see if they work and generally experiment with the different types of code they I could put in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, but I would have hoped to experiment and work with more pieces of code than I did.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>I was working with my neighbour and his neighbour on the other side and we all got through the work and code very fast and efficiently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did chat a little bit about off topic topics with the people that I was working with and I was still getting distracted by little things that I should not be getting distracted from.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and work on my concentration and I will try to stay on topic for the whole lesson next week.</td>
